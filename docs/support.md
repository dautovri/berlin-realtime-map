## FAQ

### Where does the real-time data come from?

The app uses public transport real-time data via VBB/HAFAS (Berlin-Brandenburg).

### Does the app collect personal data?

No. The app is designed to be **privacy-first** and does not collect personal data.

### Does the app track my location?

No tracking. If you grant location permission, it’s used **only to show nearby transit** on-device.
